Basic activities include the funding of marketing agency (Serotonin) including growth marking tooling (Addressable, Spindle),market maker, small ecosystem events, legal services (incorporation) and hiring.

To reduce our spending, we’ve split the pay-out schedules into monthly payments

# Qubic Core Services Overall Proposal

**Proposal for approval**: Qubic Core Services budget proposal for the next 3 months.  
We’re changing our name from **Steering Committee (SteCo)** to **Qubic Core Services (QCS)** as it better reflects the services we want to provide to Qubic and the community.

## Finance through CCF Donations

QCS is requesting funding from the **Computor Control Fund (CCF)** to fund running costs like overhead and to fund larger impact initiatives from Marketing and Ecosystem. The budget overview includes a breakdown of the different workgroups and their budgeted expenditure.

---

## Details about Workgroups

All QCS workgroups work closely together to achieve the following three objectives:

- Develop a vibrant ecosystem for all our stakeholders (token holders, miners, partners, and institutions).
- Advance AI research and core development.
- Ensure Qubic’s ecosystem financial health and long-term success.


### Ecosystem Development

The Ecosystem Development team focuses on expanding the Qubic ecosystem through the development of grants programs, incubator program, crypto partnerships, events such a hackathons and institutional real-world partnerships. In Q3 and Q4, the Ecosystem team has onboarded close to 10 different projects onto the Qubic ecosystem, among them Vottun and Qubex that are creating wider user adoption. The team is also responsible for maintaining relationships with exchanges, listings, market makers, and universities. The budget requested is to fund running costs, the  new market maker, and to organize smaller events.

Additionally, the team will work to pave the way for the ecosystem to operate independently in a decentralized manner as quickly as possible.

Ecosystem is also a horizontal service that supports both the marketing and core tech teams. Likewise, Ecosystem requires collaboration from these two departments.

The grants and incubation programs already have their own funding, and this budget allocation will not expand these funds. Current expenses can be viewed in the following spreadsheets:<br>
	•	**Grants**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvda8WZzVljbu6LKMxdTnNlt2Fj5T65xlH6FSOvO33k/edit?usp=sharing <br>
	•	**Incubation**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncuM_LT8HFMuD5D7FXHGrXITACNgD2W17FZqxygz58A/edit?usp=sharing <br>

Currently, they have a treasury, after deducting the payments for pending milestones once completed, of **58.3B** and **148.5B** for grants and incubation, respectively. This treasury is only used to pay for grants and incubation projects.
Ecosystem expenses are allocated for team salaries, a new market maker, events, scientific paper development, and associated costs for the mentioned operations. It is not included in the budget costs to list in exchanges.


### Marketing

The Marketing team focuses on increasing the brand awareness and visibility of Qubic. It does this through social marketing, content marketing, growth marketing, and PR. To accelerate our impact, we’ve partnered with **Serotonin**, who consults Qubic on brand messaging, earned, paid, and owned media. This budget proposal includes two options to further boost Qubic’s marketing activity:<br>

**Additional Options:**
- **Booster 1 - Tier 1 PR**: 40k p.month on top of base  -> This will allows us to advertise Qubic on renowned platforms like Coindesk , Coindesk Newsletters, Cointelegraph etc.
- **Booster 1 + 2 - Tier 1 PR + KOLs**: 80k p.month on top of base -> PR from Booster 1 with paid KOLs that are approved and management by some of our current organic KOLs that will Work only with legit and reputable KOLs.

Marketing expenses are allocated for team salaries, collaboration with Serotonin, AD spent for growth , outreach via X spaces, youtube collaborations & podcasts. Furthermore PR preferably through T1 media articles , newsletters or interviews.
**Note**: Important to know is that this is still not full throttle marketing compared to other projects and for the things we want to achieve. But while looking at the current CCF these are reasonable numbers that will still get us an awesome boost short term. 


------------------------------------------------
Additional Option 2,  booster 1: **25bn** <br>
Additional Option 3,  booster 1+2: **50bn**<br>
*Seperate Proposals will be released for CCF funding for the two other options* 


### Community Management 

The Community Management team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channel. It also relies on volunteers. Together with volunteers they are a total team of 20. The team ensures that both existing and new community members are welcomed, encourages conversations and makes sure community guidelines are followed.Furthermore there are engagement campaigns running on discord and telegram, like quizzes, game night, etc, with small prizes to win. The budget requested is to fund running costs and to fund these smaller mini games to keep community members engaged.

### Strategy, Operations, Finance (SOF)

The SFO team focuses on supporting the other workgroups and the ecosystem with strategy, operations and finance initiatives. It drives the roadmap, objective key-results, helps accelerate key- projects, budgeting, HR, legal advisory and helps to operationally onboard new projects into the Qubic ecosystem by for example providing guidance to write CCF or grant proposals. The budget requested is to fund running costs, to expand the team with 1HC to help support the growing ecosystem, to incorporate a Swiss association and to onboard an external controller/accountant that will help report expenses across QCS and/or Core Technology.

## Budget Proposal

**Table 1**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b4e301-2c42-4066-bdf1-bb3bd3eb514b)

From table 1 you can see we are asking for 512 bnQu for the base operations for 3 months, most probably split into 3 monthly requests to the computers. With optional marketing boosters increasing the request to 587 bnQu and 662 bnQ respectively, spread again over 3 monthly requests. This budget is below the CCF income rate and there will be enough funds left to finance other initiatives. 


**Table 2**

## FAQ

**Q. Why do you need so much funding now?**  
A. We need more marketing power in terms of ads on X and Telegram, paid sponsorships and onboarding of KOLs to make sure we catch the bull run. We're also expanding our marketing into the United States which will increase budget needs.

**Q. How will you make sure that marketing has an impact and what will you do if it doesn't work?**  
A. We have weekly calls with Serotonin about the growth of our channels and funnel conversions across owned, earned and paid media. We discuss opportunities and blockers. Attending are all members of QCS and some community OG's. We’re aiming to drive a 25% increase in Qubic’s X, Discord and Telegram followers.To have a 2-8% CTR from Spindl Ads to Qubic site. We’re also aiming to have at least 5 paid sponsorships, 5 media hits, 3 bylines and 2 podcasts per quarter. 
If this doesn't work over the period to February we will pivot. We can either look for another marketing agency, add in more experts or let the community take control.


**Q. How do you keep the community informed about progress?**  
A. We give weekly QCS updates, monthly marketing progression updates and a monthly spending report

**Q. Why is there no budget for listing?**  
A. We find it more important at this point to have the running costs and marketing budget approved. Also listing prices may vary and we don't want to include very rough estimates, that might be too much or too little. When we get into the final phases of closing a listing, we will request a separate budget for it. Funds are available, see question below.

**Q. Do we have enough funds to pay for your budget request?**  
A. Yes, in table 2 you can see the projected CCF balances for our proposal including both boosters. Our request is lower than the CCF income, so our proposal does not affect the current balance. But we also anticipated the Core Tech and Ledger proposal expenses. With all requests combined, CCF will have an end balance End of Jan of > 400bnbnQu (today ~555 bnQu) and at current price this is about USD 700k, which gives enough reserves for new projects or listings if required. At higher prices much more will be left in ccf. 

**Q. Are these funds sufficient for the Market Makers (MMs)?**  
A. Yes, these funds should be enough at this point. We have secured a partnership with a new MM which we will announce soon. We receive 246bln back from the previous market maker and these will move into the new market maker

**Q: how does the payout schedule and weekly ccf projections look like:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31979fa4-ea05-425b-b71f-08f29b478324)


**Q. Why should we use KOLs?**
A.To boost existing content creation, to boost brand awareness and visibility. It will help us to reach audiences outside of the POW bubble. If booster 2 is approved, KOLs will be carefully selected. These will be our organic KOLs that have our best interest in mind and are totally in the scene. They offered to give options and to manage them.

**Q. Will there be enough Qu’s left together with the QCT proposal?**
A. Please look at table 2. It shows about 400bln left at the end of January. About 700k usd at 0.0000016.

**Q. Will this proposal impact QEarn?**
A. No, because QEarn does not get paid by CCF but from directly by taking the emission.

**Q. How many "marketing entities" do we need on Qubic??? What's the actual work of Serotonin if you still need to do this kind of proposal? Or is it based on Serotonin advices?**
A. This is partially build on top of Serotonin. So more paid sponsorships, more PR, targeted advertising on audiences outside of the current and quality KOL’s depending on the “booster” we choose. In-House marketing coordinates everything with Serotonin and will do the same with a new market maker in one tandem

**Q. I like Qubic but I don’t see on tech side not a really good performance.**
A. Ecosystem will be focused on getting more teams and projects into Qubic, we already have more on the pipeline. 
We will collaborate with core tech very tightly, JT has also very good ideas. 
This is a big push to make the ecosystem drive by itself.

**Q. What about the new market maker?**
A. About the new market maker. It will be aligned with our strategies and we will have to institutional MM resources to monitor the performance and statistics. The new market maker is aligned with Qubic as they will invest in Qubic

**Q. Can you sell 55bln OTC?**
A. Yes we can sell this OTC. There’s plenty of OTC investor interest. In addition costs like overhead or salaries are often paid in Qu’s. Some employees might decide to hold the majority of their Qu’s. 

**Q. Where can I see all granted projects? I do see a high risk in miss balancing the distribution of funds towards marketing/ecosystem efforts instead of focusing on the tech. Especially as I do not see objectifiable marketing results. - I would rather see a couple of useful smart contracts and ideas to bring this forward.**

**Q. Why the name change from SteCo to Qubic Core Services?**
A. Because Qubic Core Service is literally part of the core of Qubic and supports growth of the entire Qubic ecosystem. It includes ecosystem development, marketing, operations, finance, legal and market makers. 

**Q. Why are we doing ads on X? I only see bots and scammers doing adds on X.**
A. X ads is simply a small part of a larger marketing mix. Community engagement is very high on X and Telegram and it allows us to target very specific audiences according to the data that we have and build. We for example know from which demographics users are visiting our websites. Via X (and other channels) we can target those same audiences and redirect them to our pages.Below image shows the numbers of impressions we gather after a relatively small spend:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48328c0a-de4a-4300-b95a-4e0c44728a6a)



The 'results' which are roughly 1 for every 800 impressions will get better too. The system is learning the behaviour of people who click on the advert, and it will be able to target people better as the campaign continues

**Q. Are there any metrics to measure the success of those different marketing options?**
A.KR1: Drive a 25% increase in Qubic's X followers KR2: Drive a 25% increase in Qubic's Discord followers KR3: 2-8% CTR from Spindl Ads to the Qubic site KR4: Drive a 25% increase in Qubic's Telegram followers KR5: 5 paid sponsorships per quarter, generate 1,000 unique clicks KR6: Deliver PR Strategy tailored for brand building + exposure KR7: Conduct executive interviews and create bios for key spox KR8:Conduct group and individual media trainings KR90: 6 Media hits per Quarter KR10: 3 Bylines per Quarter KR11: 2 Podcast per Quarter (If we decide to do KOLs) KR12: 3 KOL campaigns per quarter, generate 50,000 impression.

**Q. What happened with the 225bln on Marketing previously?**
A. Mainly salaries. The big misunderstanding is that Marketing Team was really big before the recent restructure of steco. All ecosystem Managers Like Alber, Eric, aleish etc, were also hired and paid by Marketing Budget. Things we achieved:
- optimized Website<br>
- grew on X and other Socials<br>
- consistent Blog updates<br>
- whitepaper at 95% finished<br>
- updated the docs and the Tech Docs<br>
- Had several Events & attended several conventions. Speaker Slots and Panel discussion to be recognized as a relevant Project in the Space.<br>
- started Grant & incubatotion program<br>
- onboarded the First external Teams & more in the pipeline<br>
- got our First Hardware Wallet "hashwallet"<br>
- intensive connections established for things to come. E.g. in regards to partnerships, outsourcing of CP, Exchange listings or upcoming x spaces with T1 Exchanges.<br>
- established setup for ads with extensive targeting with "Wallet awareness" through different plattforms<br>
- qubic academy finished at 80% to give new Users an easy kickoff and understanding into the uniqueness of qubic<br>
-broad coverage in the Media , See qubic-press and much more<br>

**Q. Will you ask in a vote for payouts or will comps have to make a proposal and to vote against if they don't like it?** 
A. we will have to make monthly request afaik.

**Q. What about the message we want to share? What content are we sending out?**
A. We're following up with the "Forget What You Know. This is Qubic" brand messaging. Diff variants will spawn of that and are split tested across diff channels. They are targedted at crypto audiences that care more about the crypto fundamentals around Qubic eg, smart contracts, feeless, 55mln tps etc. and across audiences that are more looking for AI
AI brand messaging is for example: "Turning energy into intelligence" or "Qubic is the chain that creates AGI"
These is an examples of a design asset that is advertised live

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbee53b-2278-4dc1-bd80-590b81af7f0f)


**Q. What do you think about putting more effort on content creation ? Talking about the projects built on the network, what Qubic could be used for (there's a lot to say here) ? And putting mechanisms that push the community to interact much more, incentives**
A. Great feedback, we appreciate it. It has been planned as a series i.e. the grant projects etc. You saw we covered the last ones as well. For mechanisms we have the Ambassadors pushing and the community here pushing. Our engagement rate is high however I feel that we need to bring in KOLs to spread the word. Right now we need fast spreading of the name Qubic. For it to be visible everywhere so when retail comes online looking for what to buy, they see Qubic Ai and buy it. Imagine you as retail hearing btc breaking ATH and Trump pro crypto. You wanna know what to buy, you go on social and see qubic everywhere. That's what you buy.It's a precedent not a degen first time gamble.
We meet our audience where they are. Coindesk, CoinTelegraph, Pukecast in Asia etc..

**Q. Will you market the entire ecosystem?**
A. We will Market all the Teams and Projects on their way to the final products and beyond.

**Q. Have we done enough to reach our desired target audiences?**
A. I think this is the base and are currently fundamental of what we need to do but you need to scale that or boost that into unknown audiences. Sometimes just short term, sometimes longer. The data will tell us that. We can measure attribution of these marketing initiatives. Maybe you need more this short term and a stronger focus on something else depending on whats progressing on the roadmap not sure there's a one solution at this point. 

**Q. Has there been any consideration of which target audience we should focus on?**
A. Currently its especially targeted towards holders of other AI / DePin Projects. Since we're targeting wallet-awareness, that's the First Go right now. There will be smaller campaigns For other Audiences to compare results of course

**Q. Do we have a shortlist of kols guys if the budget is approved nxt week?**
A. There is No defined list yet If Booster 2 gets Approved. Serotonin provides KOLs that we can use but i would rather go with our organic KOLs that have our best interest in mind and are totally in the Scene. They offered to give Options and manage them.

**Q. If we can get a VC to buy and then get kols in - would be a very good combo?**
A. VC is hard and probably Not possible since we dont have any Funds from where we could give them their Discount , they normally get everywhere. So approach is currently to get them into buying Open Market because its cheap and through our USPs. But they are used to getting Discounts instantly, so its a tough Task currently.

**Q. Who is part of Qubic Core Services?**  
A. The teams include:
