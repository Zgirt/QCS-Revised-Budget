## Details about Workgroups

All QCS workgroups work closely together to achieve the following three objectives:

- Develop a vibrant ecosystem for all our stakeholders (token holders, miners, partners, and institutions).
- Advance AI research and core development.
- Ensure Qubic’s ecosystem financial health and long-term success.


### Ecosystem Development

The Ecosystem Development team focuses on expanding the Qubic ecosystem through the development of grants programs, incubator program, crypto partnerships, events such a hackathons and institutional real-world partnerships. In Q3 and Q4, the Ecosystem team has onboarded close to 10 different projects onto the Qubic ecosystem, among them Vottun and Qubex that are creating wider user adoption. The team is also responsible for maintaining relationships with exchanges, listings, market makers, and universities. The budget requested is to fund running costs, the  new market maker, and to organize smaller events.

Additionally, the team will work to pave the way for the ecosystem to operate independently in a decentralized manner as quickly as possible.

Ecosystem is also a horizontal service that supports both the marketing and core tech teams. Likewise, Ecosystem requires collaboration from these two departments.

The grants and incubation programs already have their own funding, and this budget allocation will not expand these funds. Current expenses can be viewed in the following spreadsheets:<br>
	•	**Grants**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvda8WZzVljbu6LKMxdTnNlt2Fj5T65xlH6FSOvO33k/edit?usp=sharing <br>
	•	**Incubation**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncuM_LT8HFMuD5D7FXHGrXITACNgD2W17FZqxygz58A/edit?usp=sharing <br>

Currently, they have a treasury, after deducting the payments for pending milestones once completed, of **58.3B** and **148.5B** for grants and incubation, respectively. This treasury is only used to pay for grants and incubation projects.
Ecosystem expenses are allocated for team salaries, a new market maker, events, scientific paper development, and associated costs for the mentioned operations. It is not included in the budget costs to list in exchanges.


### Marketing

The Marketing team focuses on increasing the brand awareness and visibility of Qubic. It does this through social marketing, content marketing, growth marketing, and PR. To accelerate our impact, we’ve partnered with **Serotonin**, who consults Qubic on brand messaging, earned, paid, and owned media. This budget proposal includes two options to further boost Qubic’s marketing activity:<br>

**Additional Options:**
- **Booster 1 - Tier 1 PR**: 40k p.month on top of base  -> This will allows us to advertise Qubic on renowned platforms like Coindesk , Coindesk Newsletters, Cointelegraph etc.
- **Booster 2 - KOLs**: 40k p.month on top of base -> PR from Booster 1 with paid KOLs that are approved and management by some of our current organic KOLs that will Work only with legit and reputable KOLs.


Marketing expenses are allocated for team salaries, collaboration with Serotonin, AD spent for growth , outreach via X spaces, youtube collaborations & podcasts. Furthermore PR preferably through T1 media articles , newsletters or interviews.
**Note**: Important to know is that this is still not full throttle marketing compared to other projects and for the things we want to achieve. But while looking at the current CCF these are reasonable numbers that will still get us an awesome boost short term. 

 
------------------------------------------------
Additional Proposal for Booster 1 (Option 1): **25bn** <br>
Additional Proposal for Booster 2 (Option 2): **25bn**<br>
*Seperate Proposals will be released for CCF funding for these two options* 

-----------------------------------------------

### Community Management 

The Community Management team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channel. It also relies on volunteers. Together with volunteers they are a total team of 20. The team ensures that both existing and new community members are welcomed, encourages conversations and makes sure community guidelines are followed.Furthermore there are engagement campaigns running on discord and telegram, like quizzes, game night, etc, with small prizes to win. The budget requested is to fund running costs and to fund these smaller mini games to keep community members engaged.

### Strategy, Operations, Finance (SOF)

The SFO team focuses on supporting the other workgroups and the ecosystem with strategy, operations and finance initiatives. It drives the roadmap, objective key-results, helps accelerate key- projects, budgeting, HR, legal advisory and helps to operationally onboard new projects into the Qubic ecosystem by for example providing guidance to write CCF or grant proposals. The budget requested is to fund running costs, to expand the team with 1HC to help support the growing ecosystem, to incorporate a Swiss association and to onboard an external controller/accountant that will help report expenses across QCS and/or Core Technology.
